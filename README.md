## Experience
I’ve been passionate about technology from a young age and began working towards my dream career early. With an academic background in both management and information systems, I’ve gained experience in Python, Swift, Pascal, and more. Over the years, I’ve developed small projects to enhance my skills and published them on GitHub. 

One of my proudest achievements was becoming a finalist in the TÜBİTAK education project category, where I had the opportunity to connect with numerous professionals in the field. In November 2023, I was selected as one of the 2,000 participants in the Google Game and App Academy, where I’ll receive 8 months of training in Flutter, Unity, and other technologies.
